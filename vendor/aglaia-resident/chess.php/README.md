# Chess.php

This project is a fork of [ryanhs/chess.php](https://github.com/ryanhs/chess.php), which is abandonned. chess.php itself was a port of [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js). Main changes compared to the original ryanhs project are:
- It is compatible with PHP 8.1.
- PHP Unit has been updated to version 9
- The documentation has been imported right in the project

chess.php is a PHP chess library that is used for chess move
generation/validation, piece placement/movement, and check/checkmate/stalemate
detection - basically everything but the AI.

NOTE: this is a port of [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js) for php   

## Installation

`composer require aglaia-resident/chess.php`   

## Example Code
The code below plays a complete game of chess ... randomly.

```php
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use \Ryanhs\Chess\Chess;

$chess = new Chess();
while (!$chess->gameOver()) {
	$moves = $chess->moves();
	$move = $moves[mt_rand(0, count($moves) - 1)];
	$chess->move($move);
}

echo $chess->ascii() . PHP_EOL;
```
